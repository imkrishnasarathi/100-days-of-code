# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed 50% of the first part of the course by freeCodeCamp on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, then developed a very basic console based Rock Paper Scissors Game using some of the learnt concepts.

**Thoughts:** I had already learnt all these concepts but since I am doing another course here, I needed to practice again. Planning to work on the GUI of this next.
