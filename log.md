# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed 50% of the first part of the course by freeCodeCamp on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, then developed a very basic console based Rock Paper Scissors Game using some of the learnt concepts.

**Thoughts:** I had already learnt all these concepts but since I am doing another course here, I needed to practice again. Planning to work on the GUI of this next.

### Day 2: May 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Designed the CSS and HTML for the Rock Paper Scissors GUI edition.

**Thoughts:** I was not at home, so I had to code these in my tablet and test in my phone. I will fix any designing bugs tomorrow after I return home. Since I already learnt beginner and intermediate CSS, I planned to brush up my concepts here. Will code the JavaScript tomorrow.
