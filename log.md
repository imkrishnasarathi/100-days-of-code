# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed 50% of the first part of the course by freeCodeCamp on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, then developed a very basic console based Rock Paper Scissors Game using some of the learnt concepts.

**Thoughts:** I had already learnt all these concepts but since I am doing another course here, I needed to practice again. Planning to work on the GUI of this next.

### Day 2: May 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Designed the CSS and HTML for the Rock Paper Scissors GUI edition.

**Thoughts:** I was not at home, so I had to code these in my tablet and test in my phone. I will fix any designing bugs tomorrow after I return home. Since I already learnt beginner and intermediate CSS, I planned to brush up my concepts here. Will code the JavaScript tomorrow.

### Day 3: May 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked with the Rock Paper Scissors GUI. Fixed designing bugs and edited the design, added some elements.

**Thoughts:** The elements were pretty small so I fixed them and also center aligned them. Made the page more responsive. Added a button that looks like the MacOS buttons, also created the variables in JS storing the elements required using selectors. Uncommented and deleted some JS code. Won't start the freeCodeCamp course again until I complete this!
