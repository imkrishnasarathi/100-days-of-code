# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Developed a very basic console based Rock Paper Scissors Game.

**Thoughts:** I had already learnt all these concepts but since I am doing another course here, I needed to practice again. Planning to work on the GUI of this next.
